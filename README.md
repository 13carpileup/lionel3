# lionel3

A replacement for the infamous [lionel 2](https://lionel2.kgv.edu.hk/). 

This project is currently WIP.

This repository contains a functional API for various desirable student data collections (timetable, homework, etc) built with Rust on Axum hosted with Shuttle (publicly hosted so it can be used by any of your apps). A proof of concept frontend for this api is hosted by vercel at [https://lionel3.vercel.app/#/](https://lionel3.vercel.app/#/). It is quite ugly. I am not very good at front-end UI/UX.

```
Current features:
 - Exam Countdown
 - Student data API
 --> functional endpoints for timetables, homework logs, & misc student data
 - School data API
 --> functional endpoints for events & bulletin
 - User Verification
 --> allows you to verify if a user's lionel string matches with their id
 ```
 
 ```
 Features to come:
  - Built out front-end (classes? messaging? the api has a lot of potential that I might make make use of later)
  ```
  
If you want to contribute (either to the frontend or backend) branch then make a PR.
